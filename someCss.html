                Where's the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?

                Betty Botter bought some butter, 
                but the butter, it was bitter. 
                If she put it in her batter, 
                it would make her batter bitter, 
                but a bit of better butter, 
                that would make her batter better.
